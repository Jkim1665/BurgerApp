# BurgerApp
This app will store every burger in a database.

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
